About
This is my personal website, initially forked from https://github.com/tosinamuda/website 
But the recent version is from https://github.com/faith-nte/next-wp 
This website is built with Next.js, Tailwind CSS, and TypeScript. 
The blog content is managed using a WordPress setup integrated into the website via a RESTful API.

Dependencies

TypeScript
Next.js
Netlify
Tailwind CSS
WordPress with the RESTful APO plugin

If you'd like to use this as your template, clone the repository and run it like any standard Next.js app.
